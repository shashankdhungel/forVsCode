## Introduction

This tool is designed to help data scientists and analysts quickly and easily process and analyze data from CSV files. With a focus on simplicity and ease of use, it provides various functionalities for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

## Features

- Load and inspect CSV files
- Clean and preprocess data
- Generate summary statistics
- Create various types of plots (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots)
- Export cleaned data to a new CSV file

## Installation

To use this tool, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analysis-tool.git
    cd data-analysis-tool
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the data analysis tool, run the `main.py` script with the path to your CSV file as an argument:

```bash
python main.py path/to/your/data.csv# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
